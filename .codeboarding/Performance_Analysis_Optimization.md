## Component Details



This subsystem is dedicated to the rigorous evaluation and enhancement of trading strategies. It encompasses the calculation of a wide array of performance metrics and the systematic optimization of strategy parameters to identify the most effective configurations.



### Metrics Base Calculation

This component serves as the foundational engine for quantifying trading strategy performance. It is responsible for calculating a comprehensive set of financial metrics, including returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio, alpha, beta, and maximum drawdown, directly from the raw trading orders, actions, capital, and benchmark data. It also offers functionalities for visualizing these core metrics.

### Metrics Scoring

This component acts as a crucial intermediary, bridging the gap between raw metric calculations and the optimization process. It is responsible for processing and scoring the results of individual backtests by aggregating and interpreting the detailed metrics provided by the `Metrics Base Calculation`. This consolidated score is then utilized by the `Grid Search Optimization` component to effectively compare and rank different strategy configurations. It provides a flexible framework for defining various scoring methodologies.

### Grid Search Optimization

This component is the primary driver for hyperparameter optimization within the system. It systematically explores various combinations of trading strategy parameters (e.g., buy factors, sell factors, stock pickers) by running multiple backtests for each configuration. It leverages multiprocessing to efficiently execute these backtests and collects their results, which are then passed to the `Metrics Scoring` component for evaluation.

### Grid Helper

This component provides utility functions and helper methods that streamline and simplify the grid search process. Its responsibilities include generating structured combinations of factors suitable for the grid search and assisting in the analysis and visualization of the optimization results.
